Measuring student progress and the effectiveness of learning is fundamental in the educational field. The Quiz System offers an innovative solution that allows teachers and students to track academic performance on a regular basis. Through this system, short assessments (quizzes) can be designed to cover a wide range of subjects, providing accurate evaluations of student performance. Built using Java, the system ensures high performance and scalability. It features a user-friendly interface that enables teachers to create and distribute quizzes, while students can easily access and complete these assessments within a specified timeframe. Upon completion, the system analyzes the results and generates detailed reports on performance, helping to identify each student's strengths and weaknesses.
